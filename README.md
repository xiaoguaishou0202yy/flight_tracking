# FlightTracker Web App
Welcome to the **FlightTracker Web App**, a comprehensive aviation tracking tool designed for both aviation enthusiasts and travelers. This application provides detailed, real-time information on flights between cities, nearby airports, and flights arriving at nearby destinations.

## Features
1. City-to-City Flight Search: Search for all scheduled flights between two cities, with detailed information including the days of the week each flight operates, flight numbers, departure and arrival airports, as well as departure and arrival times.
2. Real-Time Location Tracking: Displays the user's current location and automatically identifies nearby airports, making it easy to find the nearest departure points no matter where you are.
3. Destination Flight Information: For flights arriving at nearby airports, the app provides comprehensive details such as altitude, direction, latitude, longitude, and current flight status.

## Technologies Used
1. AWS Backend Stack: The application is powered by various AWS services, providing scalable and reliable backend infrastructure. 
2. JavaScript and Node.js: Utilizes JavaScript for frontend and backend logic, with Node.js running the server environment. This setup facilitates a non-blocking, event-driven architecture capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections with high throughput.
3. Leaflet.js and Bootstrap: Leaflet.js is used for interactive mapping capabilities that track flights in real-time, while Bootstrap frameworks ensure a responsive and mobile-first user interface.

## Project Structure
**Final Project Files Folder**: Contains all the essential files needed to run the application:
1. server.js: Configures the server and sets up API endpoints.
2. app.js: Handles the business logic of the application, interfacing between the frontend and the backend.
3. index.html: Serves as the entry point of the application, hosting the user interface.

### Final Note
This application is built using a backend stack. Considering the complexity and challenges associated with reviewing code and architecture solely through textual documentation, I have attached a video (video.mp4) and some screenshots here as part of this repository.
